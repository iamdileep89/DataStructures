/*
Hash Tables are used to store key-value pairs
They are like arrays, but the keys are not ordered
Unlike arrays, hash tables are fast for all of the following operations
  finding values
  adding new values
  removing values

Every programming language has some sort of hash data structure
Because of their speed, hash tables are very commonly used

Eg:
  Python has dictionaries
  JS has Objects and Maps
  Java, Go & Scala have Maps
  Ruby has Hashes


Eg: human readable keys in colors hash table
  pink ---> #ff69b4
  orangered ---> #ff4500
  cyan ---> #00ffff

  colors["pink"] ---> #ff69b4
